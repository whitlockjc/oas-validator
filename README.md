# OpenAPI Specification Validator

The purpose of this project is to provide a lightweight JavaScript API for validating [OpenAPI][openapi] specification
documents.  This project's validator originated in [sway][] and was broken out into a lighter-weight library
[by community request](https://github.com/apigee-127/sway/issues/68).  As a result, this project will only do validation
and will not concern itself with retrieving your documents, resolving the references in your documents, etc.

**More to come...**
